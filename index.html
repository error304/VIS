<a id="target-application" class="anchor" href="#target-application" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Target Application</h2>

<p>GeneCalc allows users to visualize datasets through R-Apps. This helps people with little to no experience in </p>

<p>programming to utilise R. Instead of actually programming the desired plot, one simply selects a </p>

<p>visualization method (i.e. histogram) and enters the parameters into the provided textboxes. 
The problem is that this whole workflow only works with exactly one set of parameters at a time. Many user </p>

<p>will want to test multiple ranges of parameters to find the desired result. Having to enter a set of </p>

<p>parameters and then wait for the computer to finish the calculations does not only waste a lot of time it </p>

<p>also interrupts the workflow of the user considerably.
Solving this problem requires users to be able to enter ranges of parameters instead of only a single set. </p>

<p>With this a problem in presentation arises, since many results in form of complex objects may appear and have </p>

<p>to presented to the user. This will mostlikely be done by clustering the results and only showing examples or </p>

<p>averages of those clusters to the user. They can then choose a to inpect a cluster, which either shows all </p>

<p>results of that cluster or shows again some subclusters of this cluster. Following the design principle of </p>

<p>showing first an overview and only later zooming in and providing details.</p>

<h2>
<a id="dataset" class="anchor" href="#dataset" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Dataset</h2>

<p>The data is a table consisting mainly of floats. Each row represents a gene and each colum a celltype. The </p>

<p>floats try to show the likelyhood of a gene being responsible for a cell to form a certain celltype. Since </p>

<p>this is real world data, there is quite a lot of noise and often multiple samples of the same type must be </p>

<p>taken and recorded to be sure that the results are not distorted too much by noise.</p>

<p>The program is supposed to work with any data. The data described above is just used by the test users, since </p>

<p>those are biologists.</p>

<h2>
<a id="users" class="anchor" href="#users" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Users</h2>

<p>The users will have little to no programming knowledge, but want to have powerful visualizations of their </p>

<p>data. </p>

<h2>
<a id="tasks" class="anchor" href="#tasks" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Tasks</h2>

<h3>
<a id="parameters" class="anchor" href="#parameters" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Parameters</h3>

<p>The current state of the program allows the user to access all available parameteres for each visualization </p>

<p>technique. Most of which many users might not understand and are not necessary for the user to be able to </p>

<p>change themselves. It is important to figure out which parameteres should be presented to the user, which </p>

<p>parameters should be set automatically, and which parameters could be hidden and only shown on demand.</p>

<h3>
<a id="input" class="anchor" href="#input" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Input</h3>

<p>At the moment it is not possible to enter ranges for parameteres or multiple sets of parameteres at once. </p>

<p>Since the goal of this project is to allow the program to accept multiple inputs and generate multiple </p>

<p>outputs it is necessesary for the user to be able to input the desired parameter ranges.</p>

<h3>
<a id="automatically-set-values" class="anchor" href="#automatically-set-values" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Automatically Set Values</h3>

<p>Since users will be able to set ranges for parameters it is important to figure out a good step size </p>

<p>automatically. It is also important to have well suited default parameters and to calculate as many </p>

<p>parameters as possible automatically. This way the user does not have to understand everything about the </p>

<p>visualization method of their choosing and still get reasonable results.</p>

<h3>
<a id="show-randomness" class="anchor" href="#show-randomness" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Show Randomness</h3>

<p>Some processes involve randomness, like k-means clustering, this has to be communicted to the user, since </p>

<p>multiple runs with identical input might result in different output. This also complicates saving models, </p>

<p>since models with the same input might still be different or produce different outputs.</p>

<h3>
<a id="representation-of-results" class="anchor" href="#representation-of-results" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Representation of Results</h3>

<p>Many complex objects at once are not easily presented to the user without them having to invest a lot of time </p>

<p>to examine them all individually. It is therefor paramount to find a way to organize the output of the </p>

<p>program in such a manner that users get first an overview of the generated output and then can request </p>

<p>details for objects of interest. This will be the main focus and much more diffcult than the other tasks.</p>

<h3>
<a id="generalization" class="anchor" href="#generalization" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Generalization</h3>

<p>It is important that the input ranges and the representation of the output work for all visualization </p>

<p>techniques and not only for a select few. This might be not as diffucult once a general solution for a single </p>

<p>problem is found.</p>

<h2>
<a id="solution" class="anchor" href="#solution" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Solution</h2>

<h3>
<a id="parameters-1" class="anchor" href="#parameters-1" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Parameters</h3>

<p>A good solution would be to limit user input to control parameters and let the program itself decide the </p>

<p>model parameteres. The model parameteres are still accessable by the user, but hidden until demanded and set </p>

<p>by the program if left empty.</p>

<h3>
<a id="input-1" class="anchor" href="#input-1" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Input</h3>

<p>This is actually quite easy. Instead of having one text box for each numeric parameter the would simply be </p>

<p>two textboxes one named "start" and one "end". For non-numeric values one could use instead of drop-down </p>

<p>menus and radioboxes simple check-boxes to be able to activate all desired options.</p>

<h3>
<a id="automatically-set-values-1" class="anchor" href="#automatically-set-values-1" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Automatically Set Values</h3>

<p>The main concern is the step size of parameteres with a range of values. The step size should be dynamic and </p>

<p>focus on areas of maximum change. There should be big steps where there is little change and small steps when </p>

<p>parameter values get into certain areas with big changes. This leads to an array of steps for each parameter </p>

<p>instead of a fixed amount by which a parameter is incremeted.</p>

<h3>
<a id="show-randomness-1" class="anchor" href="#show-randomness-1" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Show Randomness</h3>

<p>One way of pointing out randomness would be to show the seed which is being used to calculate the output. </p>

<p>This seed would also be saved so each time the user loads the model they get the same results. Users would </p>

<p>also be able to manually enter a desired seed.</p>

<h3>
<a id="representation-of-results-1" class="anchor" href="#representation-of-results-1" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Representation of Results</h3>

<p>There are certainly many different solutions to this problem, but I think a very intuetiv solution would be </p>

<p>trying to cluster the output into a manageable amount of clusters and presenting those clusters to the user </p>

<p>instead of all results at once. To give the user an idea of how those clusters look like one could either </p>

<p>average all subclusters of this cluster and present a new output as thumbnail or select a specific </p>

<p>representative output and display this. Choosing a representative object would either be at random, which is </p>

<p>not really representative or choosing the object that is the most like all other objects in its cluster.
When a cluster gets chosen by the user they are presentet either the individual objects in this cluster or a </p>

<p>couple of subclusters, depending on the amount of objects and method of clustering. This continues until no </p>

<p>more subclusters are needed to represent the objects.</p>
