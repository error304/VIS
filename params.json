This helps people with little to no experience in programming to utilize R. Instead of actually programming the desired plot, one simply selects a visualization method (i.e. histogram) and enters the parameters into the provided text boxes. \r\nThe problem is that this whole workflow only works with exactly one set of parameters at a time. Many user will want to test multiple ranges of parameters to find the desired result. Entering a set of parameters and then having to wait for the computer to finish the calculations does not only waste a lot of time it also interrupts the workflow of the user considerably.\r\nSolving this problem requires users to be able to enter ranges of parameters instead of only a single set. With this, a problem in presentation arises, since many results in form of complex objects may appear and have to presented to the user. This will most likely be done by clustering the results and only showing examples or averages of those clusters to the user. They can then choose a to inspect a cluster, which either shows all results of that cluster or shows again some sub-clusters of this cluster. Following the design principle of showing first an overview and only later zooming in and providing details.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Dataset\r\nThe data is a table consisting mainly of floats. Each row represents a gene and each column a cell type. The floats try to show the likelihood of a gene being responsible for a cell to form a certain cell type. Since this is real world data, there is quite a lot of noise and often multiple samples of the same type must be taken and recorded to be sure that the results are not distorted too much by noise.\r\n\r\nThe program is supposed to work with any data. The data described above is just used by the test users, since those are biologists.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Users\r\nThe users will have little to no programming knowledge, but want to have powerful visualizations of their data. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Tasks\r\n### Parameters\r\nThe current state of the program allows the user to access all available parameters for each visualization technique. Most of which users might not understand and are not necessary for the users to be able to change themselves. It is important to figure out which parameters should be presented to the user, which parameters should be set automatically, and which parameters could be hidden and only shown on demand.\r\n\r\n### Input\r\nAt the moment it is not possible to enter ranges for parameters or multiple sets of parameters at once. Since the goal of this project is to allow the program to accept multiple inputs and generate multiple outputs it is necessary for the user to be able to input the desired parameter ranges.\r\n\r\n### Automatically Set Values\r\nSince users will be able to set ranges for parameters it is important to figure out a good step size automatically. It is also important to have well suited default parameters and to calculate as many parameters as possible automatically. This way the user does not have to understand everything about the visualization method of their choosing and still get reasonable results.\r\n\r\n### Show Randomness\r\nSome processes involve randomness, like k-means clustering, this has to be communicated to the user, since multiple runs with identical input might result in different outputs. This also complicates saving models, since models with the same input might still be different or produce different outputs.\r\n\r\n### Representation of Results\r\nMany complex objects at once are not easily presented to the user without them having to invest a lot of time to examine them all individually. It is therefor paramount to find a way to organize the output of the program in such a manner that users get first an overview of the generated output and then can request details for objects of interest. This will be the main focus and much more difficult than the other tasks.\r\n\r\n### Generalization\r\nIt is important that the input ranges and the representation of the output work for all visualization techniques and not only for a select few. This might be not as difficult once a general solution for a single problem is found.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Solutions\r\n### Parameters\r\nA good solution would be to limit user input to control parameters and let the program itself decide the model parameters. The model parameters are still accessible by the user, but hidden until demanded and set by the program if left empty.\r\n\r\n### Input\r\nThis is actually quite easy. Instead of having one text box for each numeric parameter there would simply be two text boxes one named \"start\" and one \"end\". For non-numeric values one could use instead of drop-down menus and radioboxes simple check-boxes to be able to activate all desired options.\r\n\r\n### Automatically Set Values\r\nThe main concern is the step size of parameters with a range of values. The step size should be dynamic and focus on areas of maximum change. There should be big steps where there is little change and small steps when parameter values get into certain areas with big changes. This leads to an array of steps for each parameter instead of a fixed amount by which a parameter is incremented.\r\n\r\n### Show Randomness\r\nOne way of pointing out randomness would be to show the seed which is being used to calculate the output. This seed would also be saved so each time the user loads the model they get the same results. Users would also be able to manually enter a desired seed.\r\n\r\n### Representation of Results\r\nThere are certainly many different solutions to this problem, but I think a very intuitive solution would be trying to cluster the output into a manageable amount of clusters and presenting those clusters to the user instead of all results at once. To give the user an idea of how those clusters look like one could either average all sub-clusters of this cluster and present a new output object as thumbnail or select a specific representative output and display this. Choosing a representative object would either be at random, which is not really representative or choosing the object that is the most like all other objects in its cluster.\r\nWhen a cluster gets chosen by the user they are presented either the individual objects in this cluster or a couple of sub-clusters, depending on the amount of objects and method of clustering. This continues until no more sub-clusters are needed to represent the objects.\r\n\r\n### Generalization\r\nI did not spend too much time thinking about how to handle generalization, since I am still trying to figure out how to represent the results of a specific visualization technique. Generalizing after getting an idea how the specific solution should work, should not be too complicated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Expertise\r\n\r\nI will be using Java, R, and Git all of which I am familiar with. It will also be necessary to use some biology specific R-Apps, but I do not think that those should be too difficult to understand.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
